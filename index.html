                  <p class="card-text text-start hidden">
                    Safe and effective vaccines are a game-changing tool: but for the foreseeable future we must continue wearing masks, 
                    cleaning our hands, ensuring good ventilation indoors, physically distancing and avoiding crowds.<br>
                    Being vaccinated does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put ourselves and others at risk, 
                    particularly because research is still ongoing into how much vaccines protect not only against disease but also against infection and transmission.

                    COVAX aims to accelerate the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines, and guarantee fair and equitable access for every country. 
                    COVAX is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi and WHO, with UNICEF as a key delivery partner and PAHO as the procurement agent in the Americas.

                  <h3 class="card-title text-start shown">Vaccines Safety</h3>
                  <p class="card-text text-start hidden">
                    There are strict protections in place to help ensure the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines. Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies, 
                    COVID-19 vaccines must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy.<br>
                    Unprecedented scientific collaborations have allowed COVID-19 vaccine research, development, and authorizations to be completed in record time – to meet the urgent need for these vaccines while maintaining high safety standards. 
                    As with all vaccines, WHO and regulatory authorities will continuously monitor the use of COVID-19 vaccines to identify and respond to any safety issues that might arise, and through that process to assure they remain safe for use around the world.
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="card-title text-start shown">Who should be excluded from vaccination</h3>
                  <p class="card-text text-start hidden">
                    Medical professionals can best advise individuals on whether or not you should receive a COVID-19 vaccine. 
                    There are very few conditions that would exclude someone from being vaccinated. Based on available evidence, 
                    people with a history of severe allergic reactions to any ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine should generally 
                    be excluded from COVID-19 vaccination in order to avoid possible adverse effects.
                    If you are currently sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, you can get vaccinated once your primary symptoms have resolved.<br>
                    In addition to the general recommendations above, each vaccine may have specific considerations for specific populations and health conditions.

                      Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives;

                      <ul class="list text-start">
                        <li>Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.</li>
                        <li>Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. </li>
                        <li>When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.</li>
                        <li>Don’t use masks with valves.</li>

                      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br>
                      Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness 
                      and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill 
                      and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions 
                      like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. 
                      Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.

                        <li>Get vaccinated when a vaccine is available to you.</li>

                        <li>Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible or when in poorly ventilated settings.</li>
                        <li>Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.</li>
                        <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
                        <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>
                        <li>If you feel unwell, stay home and self-isolate until you recover.</li>

                    <p class="card-text text-start hidden">
                      As soon as the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in late December 2019, investigations were conducted to understand the
                      epidemiology of COVID-19 and the original source of the outbreak. A large proportion of the initial cases in late December 2019
                      and early January 2020 had a direct link to the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market in Wuhan City, where seafood, wild, and farmed
                      animal species were sold. Many of the initial patients were either stall owners, market employees, or regular visitors to this market.
                      Environmental samples taken from this market in December 2019 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, further suggesting that the
                      market in Wuhan City was the source of this outbreak or played a role in the initial amplification of the outbreak. The market was
                      closed on 1 January 2020 and was cleaned and disinfected. The virus could have been introduced into the human population from
                      an animal source in the market or an infected human could have introduced the virus to the market and the virus may have then been
                      amplified in the market environment.
